# JS Tip Calculator

In this video, I will show you how to create a simple restaurant bill and tip calculator using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and SASS. You can use this tutorial to build your own and help you figure out the total bill amount per person and even what each person will need to tip based on selectable percentages.

This is a quick and easy project that anyone learning JavaScript can do. It uses Bootstrap for styling and we create a custom vanilla JavaScript class to handle the integration and calculations. All of it is wrapped up nicely in a visually appealing package that you can convert to an app or just use on your website.
